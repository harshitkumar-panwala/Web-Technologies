# Web Technologies Lab Files

These are my lab files for Web Technologies during my undergraduate studies. The projects and exercises cover a range of technologies commonly used in web development, including:

- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **AngularJS**
- **jQuery**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **PHP**

Feel free to explore the code to learn more about these technologies and how they are used in web development projects.
